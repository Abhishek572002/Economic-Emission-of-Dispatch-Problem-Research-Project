**Introduction**
EED: ( Economic Emission Dispatch )
The major objective of today's huge, interconnected power
systems is to distribute the load demand among participating 
generators as quickly as feasible.
Economic dispatch is the process of determining how much power
each generator in a power system will produce while minimizing 
fuel costs and ensuring that different system constraintsare met.
The system restrictions include ensuring system stability, running 
the generators within allowable parameters, and matching the power
generation with the load. When fossil fuels are burnt, toxic gasses 
are released, such as oxides of carbon, oxides of sulfur and oxides
of nitrogen.
These gases pollute the atmosphere, which disturbs the ecological
balance and causes global warming.
The environment has become inappropriate for the survival of living 
things as a result of the increased pollution caused by the increased 
energy production to fulfill the rising demand. It is necessary to reduce 
emissions and fuel costs, a process known as emission dispatch, in order 
to meet the demand for clean energy.
While minimizing the emissions, there is a need to satisfy the system 
constraints. When economic dispatch and emission dispatch problems are
combined together it becomes as EED problem.
